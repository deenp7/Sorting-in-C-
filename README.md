Here, in this repository 
all the sorting algorithms in C++ language are posted.
Each sorting algorithm is specified with its respective name.  

This repository was also created to keep a track of all my learnings 
in practising and learning all these sorting algorithms. :)

I'm open to any kind of suggestions or feedback.It will help me improve myself.
;)
